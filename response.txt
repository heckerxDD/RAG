what will happen to hold analysis when I set the input delay to 0? plase use the context below for your reference: Context:
Chapter 9: Delay Calculation
Multi-Input Switching Analysis
data paths are usually short, where a small decrease in delay can be important. For this 
reason, multi-input switching analysis applies only to minimum-delay (hold) checking.
Multi-Input Switching Analysis Modes
Multi-input switching analysis provides two analysis modes, basic  and advanced .
Basic Multi-Input Switching Analysis
This mode relies on user-defined delay-scaling coefficients that are applied to library cells 
by the set_multi_input_switching_coefficient  command.
For example,
pt_shell> set_multi_input_switching_coefficient \ 
            [get_lib_cell lib1/NAND4gx] -rise -delay 0.683
To determine the correct delay adjustment factor for each multi-input combinational cell 
and output transition type, use the HSPICE tool or other simulation tool to find the actual 
reduced delays when all inputs switch simultaneously.

Setup 1 allows less time between launch and capture, so it is the more restrictive 
constraint. It determines the maximum allowed delay for the path, which is 5 ns for this 
example.
Hold Analysis
The hold relationships checked by PrimeTime are based on the clock edges adjacent to 
those used to determine the setup relationships. To determine the most restrictive hold 
relationship, PrimeTime considers all valid setup relationships, including both Setup 1 and 
Setup 2 in Figure 75 .
For each setup relationship, PrimeTime performs two different hold checks:
•The data launched by the setup launch edge must not be captured by the previous
capture edge.
•The data launched by the next  launch edge must not be captured by the setup capture 
edge.
In the following example, PrimeTime performs these hold checks:
•Hold 2a – PrimeTime checks that the data launched by the Setup 2 launch edge is not 
captured by the previous capture edge.

To perform hold checking, the tool considers the launch and capture edges relative to the 
setup check. It verifies that data launched at the startpoint does not reach the endpoint too quickly, thereby ensuring that data launched in the previous cycle is latched and not 
overwritten by the new data. This is depicted in Figure 1-16 .

Timing Analysis in the Design Flow
Timing analysis serves different purposes in different phases of the design flow. In Design 
Compiler, timing drives the selection of librar y cells used for synthesis and the allocation of 
registers between combinational logic in data paths.

Nonlinear Delay Model
The nonlinear delay model stores vendor-specific delay information in the technology library 
in the form of lookup tables. This model supports a close correlation between nonlinear 
vendor delay models and the timing analyzer calculations.
Delay analysis involves calculating total delay , which comprises cell and connect delay. 
Dtotal = Dcell + Dc
Dcell 
The delay contributed by the gate itself, typi cally measured from the 50 percent input pin 
voltage to the 50 percent output pin voltage. 
Dc 
The connect delay. It is either calculated by using the tree_type  attribute in the 
operating_conditions  group and the selected wire load model, or read in from an SDF 
file as in the standard delay equation. Connect delay is calculated by the same method 
used in other delay equations.
The CMOS nonlinear timing model supp orts two methods of computing Dcell.

To perform timing analysis before clock tree synthesis 
and layout, the logic synthesis t ool must estimate the delays from the clock source to the 
clock pins of sequential devices. 
Input and Output Delays
The analysis tool determines the timing slack for a path by comparing the startpoint-to-endpoint delay with the time span between the launch and capture clock edges. However, 
for a path starting at an input to the design, the arrival time of the data cannot be determined 
from the design netlist. This is because th e external launch time and logic delays are 
unknown. Therefore, in order to analyze the input-to-register timing, you must specify the 
external timing conditions leading up to the input  as an input delay. This concept is illustrated 
in Figure 1-10 .

Figure 1-10 External Input Delay
The design being analyzed is enclosed in the dashed rectangle. The data arriving at input 
port “A” is launched by an external sequential device clocked by CLK. Then the data passes 
through some combinational logic before reaching i nput “A.” To analyze the timing of Path 1, 
you need to specify the amount of delay from the clock edge to the arrival of data at input 
“A.” In this example, the input delay is the CLK-to-Q delay of the external flip-flop plus the 
delay of the external buffer. Y ou can also spec ify the drive characteristics of the external 
buffer for a more accurate calculation of the interconnect delay from input “A” to the 
combinational logic inside the design.

However, 
simultaneous switching can occur in circuits such as memory decoders. If a NAND gate 
is in a data path of such a circuit, a hold check is optimistic for the simultaneous switching 
case because the true delay is less. Multi-input switching analysis can account for this 
effect.
For the opposite situation where the output of the NAND gate goes from high to low, 
multi-input switching results in longer delays than single-input switching, which can affect 
setup checking. However, setup-critical data paths are usually long, with many gates, so 
a small increase in one gate delay has a negligible overall effect. Conversely, hold-critical

delay due to input edge rate (DE)
The delay incurred at an input pin due to edge rate. At each input pin, the timing analyzer 
computes the actual edge rate. The edge rate can be different for different pins on the 
net. Also, the cell delay can have a two-piece dependency on input edge rate. See Figure A-4 for an example of an input rise dependency.
transition delay (D
T)
The time it takes to change logic value due to loading at an output pin (output resistance 
times load). 
connect delay (DC)
The time-of-flight delay—the time it take s a logic transition to propagate through an 
interconnect network.

For each setup relationship, the tool performs two different hold checks: 
 The data launched by the setup launch edge must not be captured by the previous  
capture edge. 
 The data launched by the next launch edge must not be captured by the setup capture 
edge. 
Figure 3-6  shows the hold checks performed for the current example. First consider the 
setup relationship labeled Setup 2. The tool confirms that the data launched by the setup 
launch edge is not captured by the previous capture edge; this relationship is labeled Hold 
2a. It also confirms that the data launched by the next clock edge at the source is not captured by the setup capture edge; this relationship is labeled Hold 2b.

Based on the information in the document, when you set the input delay to 0 in multi-input switching analysis, the hold analysis will not be performed. This is because the input delay is not a timing constraint that needs to be considered in the hold analysis.

In multi-input switching analysis, the hold analysis is only performed for setup checking, not hold checking. The hold analysis checks that the data launched by the setup launch edge is not captured by the previous capture edge, and that the data launched by the next launch edge is not captured by the setup capture edge.

The input delay is not a timing constraint that needs to be considered in the hold analysis, so it is not included in the hold analysis. Instead, the input delay is used to determine the minimum delay required for the input pin, which is used in the setup checking.

In summary, setting the input delay to 0 in multi-input switching analysis will not affect the hold analysis, which is only performed for setup checking.<|im_end|>
