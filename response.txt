Input Delays
The set_input_delay command specifies the timing of external paths leading to an input 
port. An input delay is specifying an arrival time at an input port relative to a clock edge. This 
is the command syntax: 
set_input_delay
 delay_value
 [-reference_pin pin_port_name]
 [-clock clock_name]
 [-clock_fall]
 [-level_sensitive]
 [-network_latency_included]
 [-source_latency_included]
 [-rise] [-fall]
 [-max] [-min] 
 [-add_delay]
 port_pin_list
For basic information about specifying input delays and output delays for timing analysis, 
see “Input and Output Delays” on page 1-12. 
Applying the set_drive or set_driving_cell commands to the port causes the port to 
have a cell delay that is the load-dependent value of the external driving-cell delay. To 
prevent this delay from being counted twice, estimate the load-dependent delay of the 
driving cell, then subtract that amount from the input delays on the port.
The input delay should equal the path length from the clock pin of the source flip-flop to the 
output pin of the driving cell, minus the load-dependent portion of the driving cell’s delay. For 
example, see the external path for the L1 clock port to port IN1 in Figure 5-1.

To see input delays on ports, use the report_port -input_delay command.
To remove input delay information from ports or pins in the current design set using the 
set_input_delay command, use remove_input_delay. The default is to remove all input 
delay information in the port_pin_list.
Excluding Clocks
The tool considers the input delay on clock source ports or pins as source latency if the clock 
is propagated. The input delay can be relative to no clock, or to the clock of that source. The 
source latency value is added to the clock network delay to determine total latency.
A common mistake is to use the following command, which sets delay on all the inputs, 
including the clock input:
prompt> set_input_delay 2 -clock CLK [all_inputs]
Instead, use this command:
prompt> set_input_delay 2 -clock CLK \ 
        [remove_from_collection [all_inputs] [get_port CLK]]
Use the set_clock_latency command with the -source option to define the actual 
source latency, if any.
Reference Pin
The -reference_pin option of the set_input_delay command lets you specify the input 
delay relative to a pin in the direct or transitive fanout of a clock rather than relative to the 
clock itself. For example, 
prompt> set_input_delay 3.30 -clock CLK \
        -reference_pin u2/Z [get_ports d1]
The -reference_pin option specifies the clock pin or port to which the specified delay is 
related. If you use this option and propagated clocking is being used, the delay value is 
related to the arrival time at the specified reference pin, which is clock source latency plus 
its network latency from the clock source to the reference pin. For an ideal clock network, 
only source latency is applied.
The pin specified with the -reference_pin option should be a leaf pin or port in a clock 
network. If the -clock option is used, the reference pin should be in the direct or transitive 
fanout of the specified clock source.

When you use the set_input_delay command, you can specify whether the delay value 
includes the network latency or source latency. For more information, see the 
set_input_delay man page.
Example 1
If the delay from L1 clock port to IN1 (minus the load-dependent delay of the driving cell) is 
4.5, this set_input_delay command applies:
prompt> set_input_delay 4.5 -clock PHI1 {IN1}
Example 2
If paths from multiple clocks or edges reach the same port, specify each one using the 
-add_delay option. If you omit the -add_delay option, existing data is removed. For 
example,
prompt> set_input_delay 2.3 -clock PHI2 -add_delay {IN1}
Example 3
In Figure 5-2, consider the path to input IN2. 
Figure 5-2 Two-Phase Clocking
Assume that a rising signal on IN2 can occur 4.3 time units after the rising edge of clock 
PHI2 and a falling signal has a delay of 3.5 units to reach IN2 (the maximum and minimum 
times are the same in this case). Input delay is defined as
prompt> set_input_delay 4.3 -rise -clock PHI2 { IN2 }
prompt> set_input_delay 3.5 -fall -clock PHI2 { IN2 }
